//! in place: macOS APFS (decmpfs), Linux btrfs, Windows NTFS. The kernel decompresses
//! on read, so the file keeps its logical size + exact contents and loads at near-native
//! speed while taking less space on disk.
//!
//! `compress_file(path)` detects the filesystem, applies compression, then verifies the
//! kernel reads the bytes back identically — rolling back on any failure. `probe(path)`
