//! The self-replacing stub binary (feature `exe`). A packer injects a
//! zstd-compressed payload executable into a copy of THIS binary; on first run
//! the copy decompresses the payload, writes it back to disk FS-compressed,
//! atomically replaces itself, and execs it. Every later run is the plain
//! materialized executable — this stub is gone.
//!
//! A bare, unpacked `decmpfs-stub` carries no payload, so `self_replace_and_exec`
//! returns `Ok(false)` and there is nothing to run: it exits non-zero with a
//! diagnostic rather than pretend-succeeding.
